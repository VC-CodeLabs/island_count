# Island Count

Make sure to change the ROWS and COLS #define values when changing the input grid.

Given an m x n 2D binary grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.<br>

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.<br><br>

 

**Example 1:**<br>
Input: grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]<br>
]<br><br>
**Output:** 1<br><br>


**Example 2:**<br>
Input: grid = [<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],<br>
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]<br>
]<br><br>
**Output: 3**<br><br>
 

**Constraints:**<br>
m == grid.length<br>
n == grid[i].length<br>
1 <= m, n <= 300<br>
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.<br><br>
